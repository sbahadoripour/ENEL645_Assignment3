# ENEL645_Assignment3
Assignment 3 code for ENEL 645 course
This code is about Cyberattack Detection in Industrial Control Systems

7 models for cyber threat classification and detection have been developed in the code such as ANN, DT, KNN, SVM, RF, GB, and AdaBoost.

There are 2 datasets:
1. Gass Pipeline
2. SWaT

I tried to investigate the effect of imbalanced data on metrics by doing representation learning, undersampling, and oversampling.
